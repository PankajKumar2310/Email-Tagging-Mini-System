Title: Creating Workflow Rules

Workflow rules help automate task creation, assignment, and tagging.

Setup:
1. Open Settings > Workflows.
2. Click "Create Rule".
3. Add conditions (ex: "Subject contains Invoice").
4. Choose workflow actions:
   - Add tag
   - Assign owner
   - Update conversation state

Common Issues:
- Conflicting rules may prevent proper execution.
- Disabled workflows will not run even if conditions match.
