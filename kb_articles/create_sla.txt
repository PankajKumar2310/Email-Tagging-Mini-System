Title: Setting Up SLAs in Hiver

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) help teams ensure timely responses.

Steps:
1. Navigate to Settings > SLA Policies.
2. Click "Create SLA".
3. Choose a rule type:
   - First response time
   - Resolution time
4. Add filters (optional):
   - Tags
   - Email subject
   - Customer tier
5. Select actions on breach:
   - Assign tag
   - Escalate
   - Notify manager

Note:
SLAs only apply to active conversations and require automation enabled.

Best Practices:
- Use separate SLAs for VIP accounts.
- Monitor SLA performance weekly.
