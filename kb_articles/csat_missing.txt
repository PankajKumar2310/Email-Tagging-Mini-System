Title: Why is CSAT Not Appearing?

If CSAT scores or survey responses are not visible in Analytics, try the following:

Common Causes:
- CSAT feature is disabled for the shared inbox.
- Surveys are not configured for the correct workflow.
- Email volume is too low to generate reports.
- Time filters may hide available results.

Fix Steps:
1. Go to Settings > CSAT > Enable CSAT.
2. Select which inboxes should send CSAT surveys.
3. Verify that the survey rule is active and has no conflicts.
4. Check the Analytics date filters.
5. Refresh the dashboard or wait up to 15 minutes for data sync.

If the issue persists, contact support with:
- Inbox name
- Screenshot of CSAT settings
- Approximate affected date range
