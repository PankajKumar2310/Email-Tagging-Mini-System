Title: How to Configure Automations in Hiver

Automations in Hiver allow teams to automatically assign conversations, update statuses, and trigger workflows based on conditions.

Steps:
1. Go to Hiver Settings > Automations.
2. Click "Create Automation".
3. Choose a trigger such as:
   - New Email Received
   - Tag Applied
   - Assignee Updated
4. Configure rule conditions. Example:
   - If Subject contains "Refund"
   - AND Customer Type = VIP
5. Select automation actions:
   - Assign to agent
   - Apply a tag
   - Change status
6. Save and activate the automation.

Troubleshooting:
- Make sure automation is enabled.
- Ensure conditions do not conflict with another automation rule.
- If automation does not run, check activity logs.

Typical use cases:
✓ Auto-assign emails based on teams  
✓ Mark resolved conversations as closed automatically  
✓ Add escalation tags for high priority cases
